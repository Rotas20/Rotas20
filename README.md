### Hi there! 
I'm begining my career as a Data Analyst, branching out from market research in the Consumer Packaged Goods space. I've recently completed a six month data analytics boot camp from Columbia Univeristy and am excited to apply my newfound skills in a professional setting. As I embark on this journey I welcome constructive feedback and the opportunity to learn from others.
